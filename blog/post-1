Hello USDA Family –  

It’s that time of year again. Today President Trump submitted his budget for FY 2020 to Congress, which will kick off this year’s appropriations process. As you know, the President proposes a budget, and Congress determines the final appropriations levels. We can’t know what the final budget will look like, but at USDA we will do our best to implement it efficiently and effectively once it passes. 

We must always remember that we are stewards of other people’s money and therefore we must be diligent in spending it more carefully than we would our own when it comes to delivering programs at USDA. With our national debt soaring to over $22 trillion, we can no longer kick the can down the road. The time to act is now and USDA will actively do its part to reduce federal spending. 

Since becoming Secretary almost two years ago, I’ve visited 49 states and three territories, meeting with farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers from all corners of our country. While the agriculture community still faces challenges, the Trump economy is creating new opportunities for all Americans to thrive. I’ve seen the very best that American agriculture has to offer, but I’ve also seen the devastation that has been wreaked on our lands from natural disasters. Destruction of life and property from forest fires, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes is always devastating, but I’m proud of our USDA family that is always on the ground to help those in need. 

In addition to responding to the devastation, the USDA family stepped in when the government recently shut down. When the government reopened, employees from every agency and mission area along with our team at the National Finance Center in New Orleans, worked day and night to process timesheets and pay for all government employees. The amazing work of our USDA family never ceases to amaze me.

As we work with Congress on finalizing FY20 appropriations levels for the Department, all of us will be focusing on the important work we do at USDA to serve our customers.  I’ve long said that USDA has the most passionate and dedicated workforce in all the federal government. That is why tomorrow at 2:30pm ET, we will host the Secretary’s Honor Awards, to highlight those at the Department who have gone above and beyond the call of duty. If you can’t make it to the Whitten building, you can watch the ceremony online here: https://youtu.be/OqqGeGVLYfE 

As always, my vision is for USDA to be the most effective, most efficient, most customer focused agency in the entire federal government. I thank you all for the work you do each and every day to help us achieve that shared mission and to always “Do Right and Feed Everyone.”
