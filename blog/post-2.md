It is a privilege to work in USDA Headquarters Complex of buildings.  These cultural icons are listed on the National Registry of Historic Places.  With that privilege comes the responsibility of proper stewardship and maintenance.  Underway are several significant construction projects at the Headquarters Complex, many of which require an asbestos abatement process.  Accordingly, you will notice asbestos abatement signage at the all employee and visitor entrances of the Headquarters Complex for your information and notification.

This signage is consistent with the District of Columbia Governmentâ€™s Asbestos Abatement protocols, which requires posting abatement notices at all employee and visitor entrances of our buildings for any abatement work being conducted within the facility, even though the actual abatement work site is confined to just several rooms.  The interior abatement signage at the construction site is consistent with Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.  

Asbestos was commonly used throughout the construction industry as an insulating and fire proofing material.  Our landmark buildings, constructed between 1909 and 1936, utilized asbestos in pipe insulation, floor tiles, and occasionally plaster.  Rather than encapsulating the asbestos, we have elected to remove or abate it as we renovate the facilities.  Elimination of all hazardous materials will eventually be achieved through complete modernization of the South and Whitten buildings,

All asbestos abatement work is performed by a professional licensed abatement contractor and monitored by a third-party Industrial Hygienist to ensure strict adherence to established U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration mandates.  In addition, the Industrial Hygienists conduct oversight and air monitoring during abatement activities to ensure adequate project safety.  All asbestos work is performed after normal work hours (6:00 p.m.), on Fridays and during the weekend.

We pledge to continue to adhere to all abatement protocol and regulations.  Our most important responsibility is to ensure the safety of all USDA employees and visitors.
