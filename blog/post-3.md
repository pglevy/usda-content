We’re in the process of making some big changes at the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) designed to improve IT service across USDA.  We want your feedback along the way to make sure you are getting the customer support you deserve!  

Last year, Secretary Perdue announced that OCIO would be consolidating many of the department’s technology support services – such as remote connectivity and help desk support – to improve the customer (AKA you!) experience, increase security, allow for better cross-agency collaboration, and decrease overall costs.  This effort is collectively being referred to as End User Consolidation.  

To ensure your needs are being met, we’ll be using a survey to gauge customer satisfaction before, during, and after End User Consolidation. The survey is being conducted by an independent organization, and your responses are anonymous.  We’ll gather feedback every quarter, but we know your time is valuable, so we set up random sampling so that no one will receive the survey more than twice a year.

Please let your voice be heard!  When you receive the survey, take a few minutes to complete it.  Your participation will help us assess the consolidation process and provide you better customer service.  The request will come via email from “CFI Group on behalf of USDA OCIO” (SM.OCIO.CIO.DCWA2.EndUserSurvey <EndUserSurvey@usda.gov>). 

If you have any question, feel free to reach out to EndUserSurvey@usda.gov.  Additional information about the End User Consolidation effort can be found on our SharePoint site.  Thank you in advance for your participation!
