Hello USDA Family, 

Christmas is a season of joy and generosity.  USDA plays a special part of Christmas here in our nation’s capital.  Each year, USDA Forest Service provides the Capital Christmas Tree from one of our national forests.  Visitors to Washington from all parts of the world are touched and inspired by the beauty of the “People’s Tree.”
 
As a member of our OneUSDA family, you can be proud to be a part of bringing joy to the world each year.  The magnificent tree on the West Lawn of the Capitol came from Willamette National Forest in Oregon.  This tree in my office came from North Carolina, and was presented by Congressman Mark Meadows’ office.
 
This year, hurricanes across the south and fires in California have prevented families from celebrating Christmas around a tree.  Many communities are struggling with the heart-breaking loss of lives and property. 
 
Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Paradise, California with community leaders and disaster recovery workers after Thanksgiving, and I saw the heroic determination in their eyes.  Two of our US Forest Service Hotshot firefighters lost their own homes, but they stayed and helped fight fires.  When the smoke settled, Paradise was little more than ashes and melted steel.  While the ravages of the inferno destroyed the physical, it did not destroy the spirit of the people. 
 
Christmas is a season of hope and giving.  Through these tragedies, we see love, generosity and hope extended to the hurting and those in need.  This is a reflection of the true essence of Christmas, when God gave His Son for a lost and hurting world.
 
We truly are a blessed nation.  I am proud to be a part of a generous and giving USDA family.  Our motto, “Do Right and Feed Everyone,” carries an even stronger meaning at this time of year.  Mary and I extend to you and yours that greeting of joy and peace that is understood around the world.
 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
